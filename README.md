# Grease pencil Box deform 

Blender addon - Modal that create temporary deforming rectangle around selected GP points.

### Note : Since Blender 2.91, `Box deform` is integrated in the official addon `Grease Pencil Tools` bundled in Blender. You just have to activate it.

## Description

I first created this as a prototype following my request post : [Cage deform active tool for grease pencil](https://blender.community/c/rightclickselect/P9fbbc/)

Turns out this works really well as it is, so I added some shortcuts for usability and voil√† !  
Developed for Grease pencil, (mesh might be supported in the future.)

Example with lattice subdiv and spline deformations.

![box demo](https://github.com/Pullusb/images_repo/raw/master/box_deform_demo.gif)

**How to use**: (same tutorial in addon preferences)  
Use the shortcut `Ctrl + T` in available modes  
The lattice box is generated facing your view so be sure to face canvas to avoid unintentional anamorphosis offset  
Then use following shortcuts (also displayed in topbar):  

**Modes and deformation target**:

- Object mode : The whole GP object is deformed
- GPencil Edit mode : Deform Selected points
- Gpencil Paint : Deform last Strokes
<!-- - Lattice edit : Revive the modal after a ctrl+Z (special case) -->

**Shortcuts** (also displayed in topbar):

- `Spacebar` / `Enter` : **Confirm**  
- `Delete` / `Backspace` / `ctrl+T` / `Tab`(twice) : **Cancel**  
- `M` : **Toggle Linear and Spline** mode at any moment (disable autoswap on first use)
- `1-9 top row number` : Shortcut to **subdivide box**  
- `Ctrl + arrows-keys` : **Subdivide** the box incrementally in **individual X/Y axis**  

Notes :

If you return in box deform after applying with a ctrl+Z, you need to hit ctrl+T again to revive the modal.

A cancel warning will be displayed the first time you hit Tab (to avoid mis-canceling)

Multiframe edit selection works but you will only see the current frame during the modal


### Todo:

- Find a way to detect other modal to use `ESC` key for cancelling when only one running
- target meshes
